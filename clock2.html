			While the exact time of the clock's origin is uncertain, one of the earliest moments of landmark achievement in the tool's history came with John Harrison's marine chronometer. 
			<br />
			The chronometer, an 18th century innovation for those navigating the seas, took Harrison more than 30 years to perfect.
			<br />
			The chronometer was one of the earliest recorded instances of the use of a precise, accurate, and portable timepiece with the ability to determine longitude by measuring the time of a fixed location, such as Greenwich Mean Time, and the time at the user's current location.
